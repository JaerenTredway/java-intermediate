Nonogram program by Jaeren Tredway

Please place all three of my modified files in your src
directory:

Nonogram.java
NonogramPanel.java
NonogramGUI.java

I added a 'submit' button that will display a modal that tells
the user if their solution is correct or not.

Also I have set the main() method to start the GUI with a correct
solution already loaded, so it is faster for the TA to remove
cells, submit incorrect solution, then replace those cells and
submit again to see the winning message.  Or you can reset to
have a blank board, or comment-out the TESTS section of main() to
start with a blank board.

Thanks!
